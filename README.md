The world is moving towards a Gitops methodology, so while playing around with Keycloak/RHSSO  
I've found out there is a way to pull the configuration files from a git repo.  

There are only few documentations about it,   
1 - https://www.wildfly.org/news/2018/09/28/Git-History/  
2- https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/7.2/html/configuration_guide/jboss_eap_management#using_git_to_manage_configuration_data  
3- https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3943361  
  
I have problems configuring it to work properly, so I decided do document my steps.
